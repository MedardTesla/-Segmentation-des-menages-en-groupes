# U.S. consumer finances
In this project, we will be working with data from the US Survey of Consumer Finances. Our aim is to identify US households that have difficulty obtaining credit, and then segment these households into groups for targeted outreach.

The SCF survey is sponsored by the U.S. Federal Reserve. It collects financial, demographic and opinion information on families in the United States. The survey is conducted every three years, and we will be working on an extract of the 2019 results.
